### Findings

1. The overall attrition rate, and how it compare across departments:

        Overall attrition rate: 16.1%
        By department: R&D (56%), Sales (39%), HR (5%)

4. Below is the department with the highest and lowest attrition count:

        Highest: R&D (133)
        Lowest: HR (12)

3. Attrition distribution by education field:
      
        Life Sciences: 89
        Medical: 63
        Marketing: 35
        Technical Degree: 32
        Other: 11
        Human Resources: 7

4. Gender distribution of employees across different age ranges:

        Under 25: Male 60, Female 37
        25–34: Male 337, Female 217
        35–44: Male 309, Female 196
        45–54: Male 132, Female 113
        Over 55: Male 44, Female 25

5. Age group with the highest and lowest number of employees:

        Highest: 25–34 (554 total)
        Lowest: Over 55 (69 total)

6. Average age of employees:

        Average age overall: 37

7. Job role with the highest and lowest number of employees:

        Highest: **Sales Executive (326)
        Lowest: Human Resources (52)

8. How job satisfaction ratings differ across various roles:

        Satisfaction scores vary widely.
        For example, Sales Executive has many in level 4 (112) and level 3 (94).
        HR has smaller counts spread fairly evenly.
        Roles like Research Scientist and Laboratory Technician show significant numbers across ratings 2–4.

9. Job role that has the most employees reporting low satisfaction (rating 1 or 2):

        Laboratory Technician: 56 (rating 1) + 48 (rating 2) = 104
        The percentage seems the highest when compared to the total employees in that department.

10. Percentage of total attrition that comes from Life Sciences versus other education fields:

        Total attrition = 237.
        Life Sciences attrition = 89.
        Percentage = (89 ÷ 237) × 100 ≈ 37.6%

11. How attrition rate differ between male and female employees across age groups:

        Under 25: Male 53%, Female 47%
        25–34: Male 62%, Female 38%
        35–44: Male 73%, Female 27%
        45–54: Male 64%, Female 36%
        Over 50: Male 73%, Female 27%

12. Gender split of total employees (male vs. female):

        Male: 882 (≈ 60%).
        Female: 588 (≈ 40%).

13. How many employees are actively working after attrition?**

        1,233 active employees

14. Age group that contributes the most to attrition for each gender:

        Male: 35–44 (309 employees, highest male group)
        Female: 25–34 (217 employees, highest female group)

15. Patterns that can be observed between attrition rate and job satisfaction:

        Roles with higher attrition (like Sales and R&D) also have a mix of lower satisfaction scores.
        Job roles with many dissatisfied employees (Lab Technicians, Research Scientists) align with higher attrition pressure.
        Overall, low satisfaction (ratings 1–2) seems correlated with higher attrition counts.
